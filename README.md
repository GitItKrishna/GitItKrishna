Hi , Iâ€™m a full stack developer with a deep interest in building scalable and user-friendly applications. I work in c# , .net technologies to develop web , cloud applications. From crafting seamless APIs with ASP.Net Core to implementing clean architecture, I enjoy solving real-world problems  through code.

Iâ€™m passionate about exploring AWS and I enjoy diving into use cases like server less computing, cloud security. Iâ€™m eager to learn, experiment, and share insights. I document my learnings and journey by sharing them on my stack overflow site, personal blog  . Whether Iâ€™m debugging an issue, or exploring new frameworks I find joy in every step of the process.

<h3 align="left">I Like Documentation:</h3>
I'm passionate about creating thorough , well-structured documentation for the codebases i work on. I enjoy the process of turning technical details into accessible and actionable insights. To me, documentation is more than just notes, its a bridge between developers, a guide for future maintainers, and a roadmap for ensuring long term success in the project. 
Investing time in documentation not only helps teams collaborate effectively but also ensures that knowledge is preserved and shared. .
